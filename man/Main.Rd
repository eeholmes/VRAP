\arguments{
\item{InFile}{The name of the .rav file}

\item{OutFileBase}{The basename for the .sum, .byr, and .esc output files}

\item{NRuns}{Number of runs to use in the simulations if the user wants to use something different than what is in the .rav file}

\item{NYears}{Number of years to project forward in the simulations if the user wants to use something different than what is in the .rav file}

\item{Title}{Title to use for the report if the user wants to use something different than what is in the .rav file}

\item{TargetStart}{Target ER to start simulations at if the user wants to use something different than what is in the .rav file}

\item{TargetEnd}{Target ER to end simulations at if the user wants to use something different than what is in the .rav file}

\item{TargetStep}{Target ER step sizes if the user wants to use something different than what is in the .rav file}

\item{ERecovery}{Recovery target if the user wants to use something different than what is in the .rav file}

\item{QET}{if the user wants to use something different than what is in the .rav file}

\item{ECrit}{if the user wants to use something different than what is in the .rav file}

\item{NewRavFileName}{A new .rav file is saved in case the user has changed any values from what is in the .rav file.}

\item{forceNewRav}{Force use of new rav file.  Needed for shiny app.}

\item{silent}{Whether to show progress bar.}

\item{lcores}{Number of cores to use.  Default is non-parallel so lcores=1}

\item{save.output.as.files}{If TRUE (default), then .sum, .byr, .esc and .rav files are saved using OutFileBase.  If FALSE, no files are saved and only the list is output.}
